What is Encryption?

In computing, encryption is the method by which plain text or any other type of data is converted from a readable form to an encoded version that can only be decoded by another entity if they have access to a decryption key.In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as cipher text.

The primary purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted over the internet or any other computer network. In addition to security, the adoption of encryption is often driven by the need to meet compliance regulations.

The purpose of encryption is confidentiality concealing the content of the message by translating it into a code.
